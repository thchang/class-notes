# Class Notes

When I started grad school, I had a tough time digesting the firehose of new information and techniques that I was picking up in my course work.
To help myself remember and also to help solidify my memory of the key ideas from each class (something like the Feynman technique for learning), I started saving polished summaries of my course notes.
I still go back and reference these to this day, if I feel like I've forgotten an important definition or fundamental idea.
Maybe these will also be useful to someone else.
If not, at least they're here in a single location where I can easily find them.

The notes focus on what I consider to be the key points and ideas from every class.
I also wrote the minimum amount of text that I believe would be required to spark my own memory.
However, I did try to write in complete sentences and introduce the relationship between ideas (i.e., tell the "story" of the class), in order to give myself the benefits of teaching this course to someone else.
Which topics I included and how much detail and motivation that I used in each explanation was totally subjective to how I viewed the importance of these topics, as driven by my own personal research interests.

Most of the course notes are from classes that I took at Virginia Tech.
Some are from courses from my senior year at Virginia Wesleyan University, which I felt were important enough that I needed review, typically also augmenting with additional information.
A couple were entirely self-taught.
In the future, I may also upload (less polished) notes from post-dissertation courses and lectures that I want to remember.

## Directory structure

Each directory is named for a corresponding topic.
Additionally, the name should indicate where I learned this information, and if relevant, the course number from Virginia Tech or ``UG`` if I learned some parts as an undergraduate student at Virginia Wesleyan University.
Inside each directory, the main document that I would want to view should be named ``README``, so that GitHub will display it in the browser.
If relevant, these directories may also contain additional source files.
